# Integration Project - Individual Excercise

## Overview
This project contains sorting functions implemented in Python. The goal was to practice Git operations by creating, managing, and merging branches for each feature in a version-controlled environment. The project has three branches:
1. `main`
2. `integer-sort` (sorts arrays of integers)
3. `string-sort` (sorts arrays of strings)

## Features
### Integer Sorting (`integer-sort` branch)
Implements a `bubbleSort` function that sorts a list of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.  
Inside the `integerationProject_excercise.py` file.

### String Sorting (`string-sort` branch)
Implements a `sortStrings` function that sorts a list of strings in alphabetical order.  
Inside the `integerationProject_excercise.py` file.  

## Test Cases
To ensure that each function works correctly, several test cases have been implemented using the `unittest` framework, provided by python.
Inside the `test_sort_functions.py` file.

## Running the Project
1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine. 
1. Download the repository locally.
2. Ensure you are in the correct directory `cd <filename>`.
3. You can run the test cases with the following command `python -m unittest test_sort_functions.py`.
